The Electronics Club Lab is located in Caldwell 078. When open, it is open to any student or faculty member at OSU.

Equipment for use includes:
Digital Oscilloscope
AC Function Generator
DC 25V Power Supply
Digital Multimeter
Portable Multimeters (please don't take from lab)
Several Soldering Irons with stands.
AC Wall Outlets
OSU Wireless Access

NOTE: It can be difficult finding the room for the first time. The easiest way to get into the basement is to go through the door on Neil next to the Journalism Building. Immediately go down the stairs to your right. Once you are in the big power lab, turn left and the Electronics Lab is right there
