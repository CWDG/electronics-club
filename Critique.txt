Critique

MAIN PAGE
Is the photo on the front page licensed to be there or is it an unlicensed stock photo?

Preferably use an actual calendar not just a scrolly list of events.


ABOUT US
The "About Us" page feels sparse and does not convey much information at all.


HOWTO
For the howto pages themselves, include a link similar to Amazon or Newegg like:
        How To > TUTORIAL WE ARE ON

GENERAL
Include a news page with a sample fake news article.

We still need a link to Upverter as designated by https://github.com/CWDG/electronics-club/issues/35
integration with designs on the site would be preferred but is not necessary.


QUESTION
Is there a way to have integration with Google Drive for sharing the contents of a public folder?
